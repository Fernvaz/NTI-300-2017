# intro to rejex
sed -i 's/^/#/g' /etc/httpd/conf.d/welcome.conf 

# In rejex ^ means 'the beginning of a line
# So this command asks sed to make changes to a file (sed -i)
# And search (s/) for the beginning of each line(^/) 
# And at the beginning, add a comment (#/g) the g tells sed to do this globally
